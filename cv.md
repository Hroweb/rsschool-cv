## About Me
I'm a dedicated web developer with foundational skills in backend technologies, especially PHP, Laravel, and WordPress \
While my experience has primarily focused on backend, I'm now looking to understand the full stack and enhance my ability to build seamless, interactive user experiences.
For the coming year my goal is to develop a solid and in-depth understanding of JavaScript, \
building a strong foundation for more advanced projects and applications.

## Skills
- Wordpress
- Laravel
- PHP

## Code Example
```
function isIsogram(str){
  let letterArr = str.toLowerCase().split('');
      let existingLetters = [];
      
      for(var i=0; i<=letterArr.length; i++){
          let char = letterArr[i];
          if(!existingLetters[char]) {
              existingLetters[char] = true;
          } else {
              return `Error: The word '${str}' is not an isogram, as letter '${char}' already exists`;
              break;
          }
      }
      
      return `Success: The word '${str}' is an isogram`;
}
